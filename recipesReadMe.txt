--Recipes ReadMe--

9/20/2018

When I'm in the mood for barbecue chicken, I don't want it because it's sugar, tomato sauce, brown sugar, vinegar, and bird flesh.  I want it because it's sweet and tangy!  If we mentally process what we eat in terms of feelings instead of ingredients, shouldn't we cook that way, too?

This tool allows uninspired chefs to search for inspiration for what to cook based on how it makes them FEEL: how sweet is the dish? How spicy is it?  How much effort/time do you feel like putting into it?

Some default recipes have been loaded for convenience, but feel free to add, import, and export your own.
